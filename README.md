# Data Analysis Project
Data analysis utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Description
An investigation into firearm ownership in the United States using data from the FBI’s NICS database.

- Analyzed data in a two-dimensional dataset through data frame manipulation, computation, sorting, and counting using Pandas.
- Engaged Pandas data frames to wrangle the data, clean up, and manipulate the data structure.
- The analysis utilizes a complex computation performed through Pandas routines.
- Plot statistical and time series graphs using Matplotlib to visualize the data.
- Using Pandas, execute time series frequency calculations from which the conclusions are drawn.

## Method
The project and code are presented in a Jupyter notebook.

## Data
The dataset is provided by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation National Instant Criminal Background Check System (FBI NICS).

## Files
The notebook is provided in two formats:

- `data_analysis_notebook_web.html` &nbsp; is a HTML file of the notebook for convenient viewing in a browser. Use this file if you do not have Jupyter installed on your computer **_or_** &nbsp; to read the notebook without running any code.
- `data_analysis_notebook.ipynb` &nbsp; is the source file for the Jupyter notebook. If you have Jupyter installed on your computer, you can execute the code in the notebook.

## Code
The code is contained in the Jupyter notebook.

## Report
The notebook contains the report and the code.

## Installation
To install Jupyter on your computer, click [here](https://jupyter.org/).

## Usage
In the directory where the notebook file is located, run the command:
`jupyter notebook data_analysis_notebook.ipynb`
